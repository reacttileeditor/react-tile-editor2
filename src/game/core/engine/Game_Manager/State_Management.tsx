				I don't know if this is the right approach for the UI, but the needs of our game are sufficiently weird that I'm having to "wing it" with entirely new UI behavior.   We have two totally different things that happen if you left-click on a unit.   One of them follows the traditionalist "selecting files in the file manager" expectation, where if something is selected, and you click on it, it deselects.  This is what happens if you've got no path.

				However, there's also this competing expectation that oncence a unit is selected, we're understood to be in "path creation" mode.  When you're in this mode, all of your left clicks "set the path" - so it makes perfect sense that the easiest way to "clear/cancel" having a path would be to click right back on the unit, again.
				
				So it's a little odd; two different behaviors for left-clicking on the unit.  The first one empties the path, the second deselects the unit.
